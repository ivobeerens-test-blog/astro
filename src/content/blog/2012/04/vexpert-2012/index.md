Yesterday the 2012 vExpert awards are announced. Great to hear that I have the vExpert title for another year!

Two Ictivity colleagues are on the list too. Edwin Friesen made it for the fourth year and [Michael Wilmsen](http://www.virtual-hike.com/) for the second year. Congrats guys!

I want to thank John Troyer, Alex Maier and the VMware team for making this possible.

The full list of all the 2012 vExpertsÂ  can be found [here](https://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2012/04/announcing-vexpert-2012-title-holders.html).
