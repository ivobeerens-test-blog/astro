Last week I attended VMworld 2015 Europe conference. I had a great week filled with breakout sessions, Hands-on Labs, Solutions Exchange, parties, chats and great people.

A few new announcements were made such as:

- vRealize Automation 7 – Introducing unified service blueprint capabilities to enable IT and DevOps teams to simplify and accelerate the delivery of integrated multi-tier applications with application-centric networking and security across multiple clouds.
- vSphere Integrated Containers and VMware Photon OS – Building on the support for VMware Photon OS on vCloud Air, vSphere Integrated Containers is now also available on the cloud platform, allowing IT teams to truly support any application, including containerized applications, on a common vCloud Air based infrastructure.
- vCloud NFV platform – Designed to help communications service providers accelerate their implementations of Network Function Virtualization
- Acquirement of Boxer, [link](https://blogs.VMware.com/euc/2015/10/vmworld-europe-2015.html), [link](http://www.getboxer.com/)
