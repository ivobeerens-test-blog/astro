If you want a low power consumption whitebox motherboard to run some VMs that are not resource intensive the Asus E35M1-M PRO Zacate motherboard is an option. It has an AMD E-350 dual core 1,6 GHz processor with passive cooling, onboard graphics, max 8GB memory support, onboard LAN and 5x SATA 6 onboard. And itâ€™s cheap.

I test the Asus E35M1-M PRO Zacate motherboard in my home lab, and it will run for VMware ESXi 5.0.0 build 469512. This motherboard can be used in a homebrew server.

In VMware ESX|(i) 4.x the Realtek LAN adapter is not supported.

**Power consumption**

The following configuration is used:

> - Asus E35M1-M Pro
> 
> - Corsair XMS3 DDR3,1333-8GB KIT (2 x 4GB memory)
> 
> - OCZ Vertex Plus - 60GB - 2.5inch
> 
> - Be Quiet! Pure Power L7 300W
> 
> - Hypervisor VMware ESXi 5

Here are some test I did:

> - Startup VMware ESXi 5 30 Watt
> 
> - Idle with two Microsoft Windows 2008 R2 VMs 25 Watt
> 
> - One Microsoft Windows 2008 R2 VM with 100% (using the cpubusy.vbs script) processor load 28 Watt
> 
> - Two Microsoft Windows 2008 R2 VM with 100% (using the cpubusy.vbs script) processor load between 30 and 32 Watt

To power consumption is not bad if you want to run a couple of VMs 24x7.
