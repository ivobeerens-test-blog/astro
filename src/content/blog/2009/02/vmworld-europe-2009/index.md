I to VMworld Europe with two colleagues from our company Ictivity, we fly on tomorrow (Monday) from Rotterdam (The Netherlands) at 10.50.

I have made a personal list with the session (and meetings/parties) who got my interest. There are lot interesting hands-on labs but the are not on the session list .
