When you start the Remote Tech Support (TSM) service on a VMware ESXi host a warning and the following message will appear:

> Remote Tech Support Mode (SSH) for the host â€¦ has been enabled

[![image](images/image_thumb1.png)]

When the warning appears some Admins get a little nervous. Since VMware ESXi 4.1 Update 2 and VMware ESXi 5 the warning can be suppressed.

When starting the Remote Tech Support (TSM) service it is possible to SSH to the ESXi host.

The following script can start or stop the Remote Tech Support mode and suppress the warnings on the VMware ESXi hosts.

```powershell
