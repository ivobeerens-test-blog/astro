In version 3.3 a new product license is added. For each vCenter Server **Standard** license you will get a **free** 25 OSI pack license for vRealize Log Insight. So every customer with a vCenter standard license can use vRealize Log Insight with no additional costs. OSI stands for Operating System Instance. For example 1 vCenter Server and 10 ESXi hosts counts as 11 OSI licenses. With a 25 OSI pack, 14 licenses are available for monitoring other devices or Operating Systems (Windows and Linux).

**Software**

vRealize Log Insight 3.3 is available as appliance and can be downloaded here, [link](http://VMware.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8883ed972be404bb0bec04558&id=3bca97b975&e=93105b0ed8). The appliance is installed and configured within 15 minutes.

In order to enable other non VMware Content Packs, you'll need to purchase a full-feature license for Log Insight.

vRealize Log Insight is a log analyzer and troubleshoot tool that is available for every vCenter Standard customer. A great way to get a better view of the VMware vSphere environment you're hosting.
