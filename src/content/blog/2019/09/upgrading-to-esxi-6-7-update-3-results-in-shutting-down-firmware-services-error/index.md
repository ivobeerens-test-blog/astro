After upgrading one of my home lab servers to VMware ESXi 6.7 Update 3, Iâ€™ve got the following error when trying to boot:

> Shutting down firmware services...
> 
> Page allocation error: Out of resources
> 
> Failed to shutdown the boot services.
> 
> Unrecoverable error

After changing the boot mode from UEFI to "legacy only" in the BIOS, the ESXi host booted without the error.

VMware has confirmed that this is a bug. There is VMware community thread ([link](https://communities.VMware.com/thread/617099)) about this bug and two other workarounds. When there will be a permanent fix available is unclear at the moment.
