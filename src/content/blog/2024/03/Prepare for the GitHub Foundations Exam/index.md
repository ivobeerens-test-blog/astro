In january 2024 GitHub launched his certification program. There are 4 certifications available:

- **GitHub Foundations**. Designed to introduce learners new to the GitHub platform fundamental concepts and products of GitHub.
- **GitHub Actions**. Designed to learn how to build CI/CD pipelines, manage GitHub Actions for enterprises.
- **GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)**. Designed to teach you how to secure your code with advanced security features at every stage of your development lifecycle. GHAS is specific to GitHub Enterprise!
- **GitHub Administration**. Designed to teach you everything you need to maintain a healthy, robust, and secure GitHub environment that supports the needs of your organization. 

The first exam I prepared for is the **GitHub Foundations** exam.
