Before upgrading a VMware Horizon environment I want to known what VMware Horizon Client versions are in use. Just to be sure that the VMware Horizon clients are supported when upgrading to a new VMware Horizon version.

Another use-case is to identify the VMware Horizon Client versions that are in use for security releated issues.Â  In the VMware Horizon Administrator you can allow what VMware Horizon client versions are able to connect.

The following script displays all the VMware Horizon sessions and the VMware Horizon client version that is used to connect to the VMware Horizon environment.

Make sure that the VMware.HV.Helper module is installed ([Link](https://github.com/VMware/PowerCLI-Example-Scripts)).

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    HorizonClient.ps1.ps1
.VERSION

.DESCRIPTION
    List all the Connection and displays the VMware Horizon client version.
