The vExpert 2014 are announced. This year 754 people (including me) are awarded with the vExpert 2014 title.

Each of these vExperts have demonstrated significant contributions to the community and a willingness to share their expertise with others.

This is the fourth time I got the vExpert award. I would like to thank John Troyer, Corey Romero and the rest of the VMware Social & Community Team for making this possible.

Congratulations to all the other 2014 vExperts. The official 2014 vExpert list can be found here, [link](http://blogs.VMware.com/vmtn/2014/04/vexpert-2014-announcement.html).
