NAKIVO announced today that NAKIVO Backup & Replication v7.5 is out of beta and available. This new version includes the following new features:
- **Support for VMware vSphere 6.7**: It's now officially compatible with the latest version of VMware vSphere.
- **Cross-Platform Recovery**: With the Cross-Platform Recovery feature, users can export VM data from VMware and Hyper-V backups into VMDK, VHD, or VHDX format. The exported files can then be used for recovery across different hypervisors, cross-platform VM data migration, long-term archival, or sandbox testing.
- **Advanced Bandwidth Throttling**: Allow you to set speed limits during data protection jobs to avoid network overload for example during business hours.
- **Dell EMC Data Domain Boost Support: Dell EMC Data Domain**: Integrates with the BoostFS plugin, combining benefits of the VM backup software with the source-side deduplication offered by Dell EMC Data Domain Boost. As a result of this integration, VM backup size can be reduced by up to 17X while VM backup speed can be improved by as much as 50%.
- **NETGEAR ReadyNAS VM Backup Appliance**:  can be installed directly on NETGEAR ReadyNAS devices, creating a cost-effective VM backup appliance. The ReadyNAS-based appliance is a 5-in-1 solution featuring backup hardware, software, storage, built-in global data deduplication, and backup-to-cloud functionality. This is already possible with QNAP and Synology NAS devices.
