In VMware ESX 3.5 Update 2 Enhanced VMotion Compatibility (EVC) is introduced.. EVC makes it possible to VMotion between different CPU generations.

Processors included in the new enhanced VMotion compatibility for AMD are:

- First-Generation AMD Opteron ™ Rev. E
- AMD Second-Generation AMD Opteron
- Third-Generation AMD Opteron as well as future AMD Opteron™ processors.

Intel Processors that are VMotion compatiblity:

- Quad-Core Intel® Xeon® processor 7300
    
- Quad core Intel Xeon processor 5100/5200/5300/5400 series, based on the Intel® Core™ microarchitecture
    
- Future Xeon processors based on Enhanced Intel® Core™ Microarchitecture.
    

VMotion between Intel and AMD processors is still NOT possible. Maybe in VMware ESX 4.

More information can be found in the "VMware VMotion and CPU Compatibility"guide.
