The Tera1 zero clients has reached their limits on new features that can be added and the ability to support new features of Horizon View such as RDSH. Teradici supports the following combinations:
<table style="height: 122px;" width="600"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td><strong>Firmware</strong></td><td><strong>Horizon View Version support</strong></td><td><strong>VMware Certified</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Tera2</td><td>4.8.0</td><td>6.1</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Tera2</td><td>4.7.1</td><td>6.0</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Tera1</td><td>4.7.1</td><td>6.0.1</td><td>No <strong>(*2)</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>

**(\*2)** Tera1 zero clients are certified on VMware Horizon View 5.3 and earlier. Horizon View 6.x is not supported by VMware. If you require VMware support use VMware Horizon View 5.3 and earlier or upgrade to Tera2 zero clients.

Teradici provides technical support on PCoIP Firmware (FW 4.7.1 and earlier) for Tera1 zero clients with VMware Horizon View 6.0.1 and earlier. Here is an overview of the Teradici End-of-Life (EOL) notifications:

<table style="height: 386px;" width="604"><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Definition</strong></td><td><strong>Date</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>End-of-Life (EOL) Notification</strong></td><td>Notification of EOL provided through Teradici’s Technical Support portal.Tera1 firmware releases will not include development for new platform version support or features.Firmware updates will only be provided to address issues deemed critical by Teradici for Tera1 against supported platform.</td><td>April 21, 2015</td></tr><tr><td><strong>End-of-Support</strong></td><td>No additional firmware updates or maintenance releases for Tera1 products after this date.</td><td>April 30, 2016</td></tr><tr><td><strong>End-of-Technical Guidance</strong></td><td>The last day in which Teradici Technical Support can answer questions, assist in finding workarounds or provide development guidance.</td><td>December 31, 2016</td></tr></tbody></table>

The latest release of VMware Horizon View when written is version 6.1. Both VMware and Teradici don't have support for the Tera1 zero clients in this release.

### **So what options do you have?**

The following options can be used when having Tera1 zero clients:

- Use VMware Horizon View 5.3 or earlier. This options is fully supported by Teradici and VMware.
- Upgrade to View Horizon 6.0.1. This option is only supported by Teradici.
- Use Tera1 zero clients with Horizon View version 6.1. Don't use any new features that are introduced in VMware Horizon View 6 and later. Be sure to test test and test this option, because this isn't supported by VMware and Teradici!
- Buy new Tera2 zero clients. **10ZiG** for example offers a buy-back program for any Tera1 Zero Client when upgrading to Tera2 hardware. It does not matter which brand the Tera1 zero client is. This can reduced the hardware upgrade costs! Tera2 zero clients adds support for the latest version of Horizon View and improves performance.
