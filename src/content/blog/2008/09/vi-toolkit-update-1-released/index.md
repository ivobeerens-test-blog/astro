VMware has released VI Toolkit Update 1. There where performance problems with the get-VM command.

> Some users had reported [slowness when using the Get-VM cmdlet](http://communities.VMware.com/thread/158640?tstart=50). The reason turned out to be an odd quirk in querying some types of network adapters, so many people weren't affected at all. On the other hand, if you were affected, it was pretty annoying. To address this we've [released Update 1 of our toolkit](http://VMware.com/go/PowerShell). If you've had trouble with Get-VM, download it things will go a lot smoother. One user reported that his queries went from more than 5 minutes to just over 10 seconds -- a world of difference!
> 
> This is the only change we made to the toolkit, so don't expect lots of new functionality when you download, you'll have to wait a bit longer for that. If you haven't had any trouble with 1.0 it's perfectly fine to keep using it until the next release.
> 
> Also, many of you are probably eagerly anticipating the results of our scripting contest. I want to thank everyone for participating and point out that the entries are now open to the public. Check it out, there's a lot of really great stuff in there.
