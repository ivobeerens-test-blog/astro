- JBOD is not supported in the GA release
- What is the difference with MS storage spaces: MS Storage spaces is presenting a file server from dedicated servers and JBODs. VSAN is object storage and doesn't require dedicated servers, it uses the same servers you have for your compute, and other benefits like flash cache acceleration, storage policy management and automation and more.
