During my vacation i received an e-mail that I was designate as vExpert 2011. I was very pleased by getting the award. The VMware vExpert Award is given to:

> individuals who have significantly contributed to the community of VMware users over the past year. vExperts are book authors, bloggers, VMUG leaders, tool builders, and other IT professionals who share their knowledge and passion with others. These vExperts have gone above and beyond their day jobs to share their technical expertise and communicate the value of VMware and virtualization to their colleagues and community.

Congrats to all the other vExpert 2011. Thanks to John Troyer and the VMware Social Media team for given me the vExpert 2011 award!
