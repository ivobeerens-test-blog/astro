Eric Siebert from vSphere-Land has opened the voting for the top 25 virtualization bloggers list. Voting is very easy by clicking on the link provided. It takes only one minute. Choose your 10 favorites blogs and rank them in order of preference. The voting is from 14 September till 24 September 2010.

Two random voters will be picked to **win** a copy of the book, **Maximum vSphere** or a copy of the **Train Signal vSphere Pro Series Vol. 2** video training course.

If you like my blog (itâ€™s called virtual lef on the voting website) and all the other virtualization blogs, please vote for their hard work and dedication!
